## Task 1: Data Exploration and Summary

### Objective
Understand the dataset structure.

### Steps
1. **Load the dataset**: Import the dataset into a data analysis tool such as Python with pandas or spreadsheet software.
2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Use descriptive functions (e.g., `info()` in pandas) to gather information about the number of entries, columns, and data types.![Screenshot 2024-06-30 182257](https://github.com/NIKHILnitr/Cognifyz_BA/assets/140872474/44f1380a-811d-4c90-8b0c-63ad39a00eaa)


## Task 2: Gender Based Analysis

### Objective
Visualize gender distribution in the dataset.

### Steps
1. **Extract Gender Information**: Identify and extract the gender column from the dataset.
2. **Visualization**: Create a simple visualization, such as a bar chart or pie chart, to represent the distribution of genders in the dataset.![Screenshot 2024-06-30 182418](https://github.com/NIKHILnitr/Cognifyz_BA/assets/140872474/9586c1b2-5ec4-4772-814b-170758a4c9e1)


## Task 3: Objective Analysis

### Objective
Present basic statistics for numerical columns.

### Steps
1. **Identify Numerical Columns**: Review the dataset to identify columns containing numerical data (e.g., age, income).
2. **Calculations**: Use statistical functions (e.g., `mean()`, `median()`, `std()`) to calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation for each numerical column.![Screenshot 2024-06-30 182545](https://github.com/NIKHILnitr/Cognifyz_BA/assets/140872474/ebe5cf2b-d0e9-45be-9115-bcdcb78900e5)


## Task 4: Investment Duration and Frequency

### Objective
Identify the most preferred investment avenue.

### Steps
1. **Analyze Investment Avenues**: Examine the column containing information about different investment avenues (e.g., equity, mutual funds).
2. **Frequency Analysis**: Determine the investment avenue with the highest frequency or occurrence.![Screenshot 2024-06-30 182653](https://github.com/NIKHILnitr/Cognifyz_BA/assets/140872474/36141fbb-dba6-4dd4-9283-b50493674fc4)


## Task 5: Reasons for Investment

### Objective
Analyze and summarize reasons for investment choices.

### Steps
1. **Explore Reasons Column**: Investigate the column where participants provided reasons for their investment choices.
2. **Summarize Reasons**: Identify common themes or recurring reasons and provide a summary.![Screenshot 2024-06-30 182818](https://github.com/NIKHILnitr/Cognifyz_BA/assets/140872474/2ded6148-f154-4c93-8ffe-b4803747c1ce)


## Task 6: Source of Information

### Objective
Identify and present main savings objectives.

### Steps
1. **Analyze Savings Objectives**: Examine the column containing information about participants' savings objectives.
2. **List and Describe Objectives**: Create a list and describe the main savings objectives mentioned by participants.![Screenshot 2024-06-30 183006](https://github.com/NIKHILnitr/Cognifyz_BA/assets/140872474/ca3df600-fbd2-489e-ba32-230ec7384527)



## Task 7: Combine Insights into a Dashboard

### Objective
Explore potential correlations between factors.

### Steps
1. **Select Relevant Columns**: Identify columns such as age, investment duration, and expected returns for correlation analysis.
2. **Use Statistical Methods or Visualizations**: Employ statistical methods (e.g., correlation coefficients) or visualizations (e.g., scatter plots) to explore and visualize potential correlations.![Screenshot 2024-06-30 183142](https://github.com/NIKHILnitr/Cognifyz_BA/assets/140872474/3a22f2fe-7ff2-4b47-8ebd-6299e93a6a1d)
